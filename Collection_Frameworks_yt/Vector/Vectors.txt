Vectors are thread safe
*Key Features of Vector

Dynamic Array: Like ArrayList, Vector is a dynamic array that grows automatically when more elements are added than its current capacity. 

Synchronized: All the methods in Vector are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe. 
This means multiple threads can work on a Vector without the risk of corrupting the data. However, 
this can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments. 

Legacy Class: Vector was part of Java's original release and is considered a legacy class. 
It's generally recommended to use ArrayList in single-threaded environments due to performance considerations. 

Resizing Mechanism: When the current capacity of the vector is exceeded, it doubles its size by default 
(or increases by a specific capacity increment if provided). 

Random Access: Similar to arrays and ArrayList, Vector allows random access to elements, making it efficient for accessing elements using an index.
